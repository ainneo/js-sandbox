# Sandbox

This is where I place all my mini-projects and exercises that only require a front end.

- [Color Changer](https://ainneo.github.io/js-sandbox/colors) - Making a little color theme picker.
- [Dave](https://ainneo.github.io/js-sandbox/dave) - I don't remember why this is here, but it seems important.
- [Portfolio](https://ainneo.github.io/js-sandbox/portfolio) - Web developer resume/portfolio example.
- [Ghibli](https://ainneo.github.io/js-sandbox/ghibli) - Studio Ghibli web app for learning how to connect to an API.
